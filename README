Features Conf Wizard
====================

This project is now hosted at http://drupal.org/project/featuresconfwizard .

Feature exporting can't always capture every configuration option, 
especially when configuration depends strongly on the "business rules" 
already set up on a site (or stored in the brains of the site 
administrators.)

This module allows you to distribute configuration reminders with your 
feature. When the feature is installed on a new site, these reminders get 
added to a to-do list in the admin interface, and admin users will be 
notified as long as there are to-do items still remaining to be checked off 
on the list.
